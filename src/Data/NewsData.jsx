            firstPara : "Thunderstorms will rumble across several regions of the United States this week, and some could bring tornadoes. Even a single tornado—if it strikes a populated area—could pose a serious threat to lives and property, AccuWeather meteorologists warn.",
            secPara : "The main source of the stormy setup will be unusually low temperatures high in the atmosphere. When warm air rises into the cold layer, it can form towering clouds, drenching showers and severe thunderstorms capable of producing powerful wind gusts, significant hail, flash flooding and dangerous lightning strikes.",
            thirdPara : "Storms on Monday night will focus on parts of western and central Texas to eastern New Mexico. In Texas, the threat will extend from the Big Bend area of the Rio Grande River to Interstate 40.",

            secPara : "The emergency response began when the vessel was spotted near the 12000 block of North Torrey Pines Road after it reportedly capsized at around 6:30 a.m. local time near Del Mar.",

            firstPara : "Long breaks of dry weather may be hard to come by in the northeastern United States into the Mother's Day weekend due to an atmosphere spinning its wheels in the rain and mud, AccuWeather meteorologists say.",
            secPara : "It will not rain constantly throughout the Northeast. However, timing the breaks of rain versus dry weather may be nearly impossible given the moist pattern strewn with slow-moving and repetitive showers and batches of rain. Lawn cutting crews may have to work in the rain or risk falling behind.",
            thirdPara : "Where the sun manages to emerge for a few minutes or several hours on a given day, there is a moderate to high chance that it will lead to an eruption of showers and thunderstorms. This is because the air from 5,000 to 20,000 feet up is much colder than near the ground. So any warm thermals that rise into that progressively colder air can quickly condense into towering clouds and produce drenching showers and gusty thunderstorms.",

            secPara : "While the most widespread threat is expected to be frequent downpours that can inundate roadways and allow already elevated streams and waterways to approach their banks, AccuWeather meteorologists warn that some locations will also face the threat of severe thunderstorms this week.",
            thirdPara : "With repeat downpours in the forecast for much of this week, residents across eastern Texas and Louisiana are advised to monitor when the heaviest rounds may arrive. Intense and frequent rainfall could quickly spell trouble for travelers along portions of interstates 10, 20, 30 and 55.",

However, this discovery is an important step toward creating a sustainable alternative to cement, the binding agent in concrete, said Chelsea Heveran, senior author of the study published April 16 in the journal Cell Reports Physical Science.",
            secPara : "The study authors introduced bacteria capable of producing calcium carbonate — the same chemical compound found in coral, eggshells and limestone — to the fungal mycelium, which served as scaffolds. Through a process called biomineralization, the calcium carbonate hardened the gooey, flexible mycelium into a stiff, bonelike structure.",
            thirdPara : "We’re not the first ones to biomineralize something and call it a building material. … But if you want to keep (the bacteria) alive for longer so that you can do more with them, there’s been some challenges involved to extend that viability,” Heveran said. “So that’s why we gave them fungal mycelium scaffolds, because the mycelium is really robust, and in nature, sometimes it biomineralizes (itself).",

The REAL ID Act, which was passed by Congress in 2005, enacted the 9/11 Commission’s recommendation that the federal government enhance security standards for identification.",
            secPara : "Travelers have been scrambling to get their licenses changed to avoid disruptions in domestic travel plans this summer and into the holiday months. Passports are still an acceptable form of identification for both domestic and international air travel, and non REAL ID compliant licenses are still valid for driving and other identification purposes outside of the federal requirements.",
            thirdPara : "TSA: Passed by Congress in 2005, the REAL ID Act enacted the 9/11 Commission’s recommendation that the Federal Government “set standards for the issuance of sources of identification, such as driver’s licenses.” The Act established minimum security standards for state-issued driver’s licenses and identification cards and prohibits certain federal agencies from accepting for official purposes licenses and identification cards from states that do not meet these standards. These purposes are: Accessing certain federal facilities; boarding federally-regulated commercial aircraft; and entering nuclear power plants. Enforcement begins on May 7, 2025.",
